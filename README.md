# IDEA
This is an Advanced IDE with user-friendly interactive GUI and real-time program compilation with custom user input or input from file. 
Checks and returns back with compile time error or runtime error. It is built even with the power to detect time limit exceeded error 
where a default time-limit of 5 seconds is set. If a program exceeds the default time limit, the program will be halted with an 
appropriate error message. At the end it gives the verdict of right/wrong answer to the user when the user pre-sets his expected 
answer from the program. This IDE supports 5 most common programming languages namely, C, C++, Java, Python 3.x and Shell-Script.
This is completely built in Java taking help of shell-script for program execution purpose.
